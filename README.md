# FictiveRealityScreening
Write a function that takes an array of integers that can be nested at any depth, and outputs a flat array. E.g. [7,[8,[9],3]] => [7,8,9,3]. Use Python, C# or Javascript. Try to write it as if it was going into a production application, so consider clean code, error checking, comments, performance and testing.
